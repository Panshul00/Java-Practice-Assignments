//Exercise 3: The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following rule. The first 2 values in the sequence are 1, 1. Every subsequent value is the sum of the 2 values preceding it. Write a Java program that uses both recursive and non-recursive functions to print the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence?

public class A3_v2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a=1,b=1;
		
		int c=0;

		int choice=input.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print(a+"  "+b);
		for(int i=1 ; i<choice ; i++) {
			c=a+b;
			System.out.print("  "+c);
			a=b;
			b=c;
		}
